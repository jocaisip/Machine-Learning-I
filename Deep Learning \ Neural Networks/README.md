## Overview and Description

This project involves building a neural network NLP model that can read statements of why the person is happy and classify them into happiness categories such as 'leisure', 'affection', and 'achievement'.  

Text statements are cleaned by filtering unnecessary characters and using preprocessing techniques lemmatization and removing stopwords. 

TF-IDF is the feature extraction method used for tokenization and vectorization and model was trained on a Bidirectional LSTM model.

The dataset is courtesy of the [Happiness Type](https://www.kaggle.com/sourabhbaldwa/bonding) dataset from Kaggle.
