## Overview and Description

This project aims to build a model that can accurately predict the duration of delay of the TTC subway. Additionally, we built a classifier model that predicts whether a train is on time or delayed by creating another column with the labels for delay.

The model can potentially help make planning trips and schedules around possible delays easier when riding the TTC subway.

For the dataset, we used the TTC Subway Delay Data from [OpenData](https://ckan0.cf.opendata.inter.prod-toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-subway-delay-data) with available data from 2014-2021.
