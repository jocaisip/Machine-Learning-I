This repository contains projects in the areas of data science. 

## Navigation
Each folder holds  and code for each related project in that topic. Currently it has Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning\Neural Networks.

-  [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/jocaisip/Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/tree/main/Natural%20Language%20Processing), or NLP for short, involves text processing in applications like recommendation systems and text summarizers, and uses libraries like NLTK and spaCy.

-  [Image Processing](https://github.com/jocaisip/Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/tree/main/Image%20Processing) relates to techniques in image and video analysis and transformation, they have applications in object detection and facial recognition available such as those in OpenCV library.

-  [Machine Learning](https://github.com/jocaisip/Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/tree/main/Machine%20Learning) refers to the conventional algorithms and machine learning models, with various applications from automated classifiers and predictive modeling using the popular Scikit-learn libary.

-  [Deep Learning\Neural Networks](https://github.com/jocaisip/Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/tree/main/Deep%20Learning%20%5C%20Neural%20Networks) explores artifical neural network models and transfer learning utilizing libraries like Keras and Tensorflow.
